    "\n",
    "Modularity is a measure of the structure of a network, which is a collection of nodes (also known as vertices) and the edges (also known as links) that connect them. The concept of modularity is based on the idea that a well-connected network can be divided into groups of nodes, known as communities or clusters, where the nodes within each group are more densely connected to each other than to nodes outside the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity is a measure of how well a network can be divided into such communities. Specifically, modularity quantifies the difference between the number of edges within communities and the expected number of edges within communities if the edges were placed randomly, while preserving the degree distribution of the nodes. In other words, modularity measures the extent to which the edges in a network are concentrated within communities, rather than being distributed randomly throughout the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity is typically expressed as a number between -1 and 1. A high positive value of modularity indicates that the network is highly modular, with many densely connected communities, while a low or negative value indicates that the network is less modular, with communities that are not well-defined. The concept of modularity has many applications in network science, including community detection, network visualization, and network comparison."

    "TF stands for term frequency. Term frequency is metric that tells us how many instances of a given word (term) there is in a document. The way we get the term frequency is by getting the set of words of a given document, and then we count how many times each word occurs and divide that by the total number of words. So if a word has a term frequency of 0.1, it means that of all the words in the document, this particular word occurs 10% of the time\n",
